The aim of the training project is to diagnostically predict the presence or absence of diabetes in a patient based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several restrictions were imposed on the selection of these instances from the larger database. In particular, all patients here are female at least 21 years of age from the Pima Indian tribe.

The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable "Outcome". Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin levels, age, and so on.
